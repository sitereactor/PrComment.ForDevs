# PrComment.ForDevs
Example of auto-posting comments on Pull Requests when they are opened and merged.

The workflow available here https://github.com/sitereactor/PrComment.ForDevs/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml has two jobs - one for commenting on incoming Pull Requests and one for commenting on Pull Requests that are merged.

This example was used as one of the demos in the "Github in Action" talk - an online session for the ForDevs meetup group.
